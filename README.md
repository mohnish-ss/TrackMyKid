# Track My Kid

Track My Kid is an application that allows parents to organize certain aspects of their children's lives. These functionalities include setting their homework and sending an e-mail to their school when they are away. 

## How to use the application

To use the app, the user must sign-in to an existing account from the start screen. If the user needs to create an account, they will be directed to another screen where they will be asked to create their account using their e-mail, a username, and a password. When the user signs-in they are greeted with a home screen that displays their children and multiple functions, such as deleting a child, adding a child, setting homework, sending an e-mail, or changing their password. 

## How to send an e-mail

Sending an e-mail to the school requires the user to input the school's attendance e-mail when they add their respective child. After this, they can choose one of the three options of "sick", "doctor", or "sport" for which the e-mail template is premade. Before the e-mail itself is sent, the user can edit the e-mail to include additional information. The user does not need to enter any additional password/e-mail information for this.
